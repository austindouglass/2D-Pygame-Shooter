This was a project I worked on in the Summer of 2018 and 2019 as a fun side project to learn more about pygame and python.
It's not super fleshed out but a lot of the base gameplay and mechanics are there.

To play this game make sure to install pygame and run the graphics.py file.

I currently don't have plans to expand on this game, but perhaps in the future I could redesign it in some way.


Thank you for taking the time to check this out!
