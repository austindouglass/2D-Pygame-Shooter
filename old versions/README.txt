This was an early prototype I made for the project. This version was more freeform in that you weren't limited to 4 axes.
In this version, there are 8 axes for movement and shooting. I decided to simplify the game by turning it into a 2D array
where it's easier to keep track of player and enemy movement as well as shooting hit detection.
